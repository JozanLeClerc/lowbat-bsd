* lowbat BSD
BSD compatible version of lowbat, a small that runs in the background and warns you when your battery is low until you plug your laptop in.

This version will only run on BSD systems. For the GNU/Linux version of lowbat, check my [[https://github.com/JozanLeClerc/lowbat.git][GNU/Linux lowbat repository]].

** Dependencies
- ~libnotify~
- ~espeak~
- ~BSD make~
- ~nasm~
- ~clang/llvm~

** Installation
Open a terminal and run these commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/JozanLeClerc/lowbat-bsd.git
cd lowbat
make
sudo make install clean
#+END_SRC

Next you must find a way to get the script running right after loging in. Add this to your startup programs manager/rc file of choice:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
lowbat > /dev/null 2>&1 &
#+END_SRC

/Note:/ to get notifications, make sure ~dunst~ is running in the background. In your startup programs manager/rc:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
dunst > /dev/null 2>&1 &
#+END_SRC

** Options
Only one option is available:
- ~--say [MESSAGE]~ allows you to set an audio warning message when lowbat is active. By default ~lowbat~ doesn't send audio notifications and will only use ~notify-send~.

**** Examples of use:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
lowbat --say "your custom message" > /dev/null 2>&1 &
#+END_SRC

** Uninstallation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo make uninstall
#+END_SRC
